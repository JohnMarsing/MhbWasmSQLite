	<small>My notes on the topic of Identity (August 4<sup>th</sup> 2018) <sup class="pull-right">Who are you! Who the blessed are you!</sup></small>

<p>
	I decided to do this topic after the work I have been put in to modifying the LMM website so that it can better manage Sukkot registration.
	From a technical point of view what was needed to pull this off was a couple of things…a database and the ability to manage logins i.e. peoples identity.
	I was very comfortable working with databases, but not as much with <em>identity</em>.
	<br />	<br />I would say that being a programmer who writes code that emulates the world around us, I’m always amazed how
	I can relate and transfer this skill set into writing about scripture.
	I had some opinions on identity as it relates to scripture, so this is my introduction to the topic.
